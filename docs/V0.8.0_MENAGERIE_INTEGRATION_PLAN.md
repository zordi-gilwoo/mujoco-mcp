# MuJoCo Menagerie Integration Plan - v0.8.0

## Overview

Version 0.8.0 will integrate the [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) - Google DeepMind's collection of high-quality robot models. This will significantly expand the capabilities of MuJoCo MCP beyond simple pendulums to real-world robot simulations.

## Goals

1. **Load Menagerie Models**: Support loading any model from the Menagerie collection
2. **Model Discovery**: Tools to browse and search available models
3. **Advanced Control**: Tailored control interfaces for different robot types
4. **Natural Language**: Enhanced commands for complex robots
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for each robot category

## Architecture Design

### New MCP Tools

#### Model Management
- `load_menagerie_model` - Load a model from Menagerie by name/path
- `list_menagerie_models` - List available models with categories
- `search_menagerie_models` - Search models by capabilities/type
- `get_model_info` - Detailed information about a model

#### Robot-Specific Control
- `control_arm` - Control robotic arms (joint angles, end-effector pose)
- `control_quadruped` - Quadruped gaits and movements
- `control_humanoid` - Humanoid balance and locomotion
- `control_gripper` - End-effector grasping control

#### Advanced Features
- `plan_trajectory` - Motion planning for complex robots
- `inverse_kinematics` - IK solver for arms/manipulators
- `get_sensor_readings` - Access robot-specific sensors
- `apply_controller` - Apply pre-defined controllers (PID, impedance)

### Implementation Strategy

```python
class MenagerieManager:
    """Manages MuJoCo Menagerie models"""
    
    def __init__(self, menagerie_path: str = None):
        self.menagerie_path = menagerie_path or self._download_menagerie()
        self.model_registry = self._build_registry()
    
    def load_model(self, model_name: str) -> str:
        """Load a model and return MJCF XML"""
        # Handle paths, dependencies, assets
        pass
    
    def list_models(self, category: str = None) -> List[ModelInfo]:
        """List available models with metadata"""
        pass
```

### Natural Language Enhancement

Extend `execute_command` to support:
- "Load the Franka Panda robot"
- "Create a Boston Dynamics Spot simulation"
- "Move the robot arm to pick up position"
- "Make the quadruped walk forward"
- "Show me all available humanoid robots"

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Asset Management
- Models reference external mesh files and textures
- Need to handle relative paths correctly
- Consider caching frequently used assets

### 2. Model Complexity
- Some models have 50+ joints and complex kinematics
- Need efficient state management
- Performance optimization for real-time control

### 3. Controller Design
- Different robots need different control strategies
- Implement reusable controller components
- Support both position and torque control

### 4. Compatibility
- Ensure all models work with `launch_passive` viewer
- Handle MJX-compatible models specially
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1)
- [ ] Download/clone Menagerie repository
- [ ] Implement `load_menagerie_model` tool
- [ ] Test with 3-5 representative models
- [ ] Update viewer to handle complex models

### Phase 2: Model Discovery (Week 2)
- [ ] Build model registry with metadata
- [ ] Implement search and list tools
- [ ] Add model categorization
- [ ] Create model info tool

### Phase 3: Robot Control (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement arm control (Franka, UR5e)
- [ ] Add quadruped control (Spot, Go2)
- [ ] Basic humanoid support (H1, Apollo)
- [ ] Gripper/hand control

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Motion planning integration
- [ ] Inverse kinematics solver
- [ ] Pre-defined controllers
- [ ] Sensor data access

### Phase 5: Polish & Documentation (Week 5)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Example notebooks

## Example Usage

```python
# After v0.8.0
"Load the Franka Panda robot"
# Response: Loaded Franka Emika Panda (7 DOF arm with gripper)

"Move the end effector to position [0.5, 0.3, 0.4]"
# Response: Moving to target position using inverse kinematics...

"Open the gripper"
# Response: Gripper opened to 0.08m

"Show me available quadruped robots"
# Response: Available quadrupeds:
# - Boston Dynamics Spot
# - Unitree Go2
# - Unitree A1
# - ANYmal C
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Model Coverage**: Support 80%+ of Menagerie models
2. **Performance**: <100ms load time for average model
3. **Usability**: Natural language commands for common tasks
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling for missing assets
5. **Documentation**: Examples for each robot category

## Dependencies

- MuJoCo 3.0+ (for latest model features)
- NumPy (existing)
- Optional: `mujoco-mjx` for GPU acceleration
- Optional: `robot_descriptions` for convenient access

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Large Download Size**: Menagerie is ~1GB
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading, optional download
   
2. **Model Compatibility**: Some models may have issues
   - Mitigation: Validation suite, compatibility matrix
   
3. **Performance**: Complex models may be slow
   - Mitigation: LOD system, simplified versions

## Future Extensions (v0.9.0+)

- Multi-robot scenarios
- Robot-robot interaction
- Task-specific environments
- Reinforcement learning integration
- ROS 2 bridge for real robot deployment

## Conclusion

The MuJoCo Menagerie integration will transform MuJoCo MCP from a simple physics tool to a comprehensive robotics simulation platform. This positions the project as a key tool for robotics research and development with LLMs.
