python mujoco_viewer_server.py

# In Claude Desktop:
"list menagerie models"       # See all available models
"load franka panda"          # Load the Franka robot
"create spot robot"          # Load Boston Dynamics Spot

```json
"env": {
  "MUJOCO_MENAGERIE_PATH": "/path/to/mujoco_menagerie"
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues
