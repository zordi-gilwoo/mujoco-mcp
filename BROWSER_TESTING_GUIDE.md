python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Running Tests

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite

# Run integration tests only
python tests/test_mcp_browser_integration.py

# Run with pytest (if Playwright browsers are installed)
pytest tests/test_e2e_browser.py -v
```

### Using Pytest Configuration
```bash
# Run with specific browser configuration
pytest -c pytest-browser.ini tests/test_e2e_browser.py
```

## Web Interface Features Tested

### Command Interface
- **Command Input**: Natural language command textarea
- **Execute Button**: Command execution trigger
- **Suggestion Buttons**: Quick command selection (Pendulum, Franka Panda, Cart Pole, etc.)
- **Result Display**: Command output and feedback area

### Camera Controls
- **Preset Views**: Front, Side, Top, Reset camera positions
- **Interactive Controls**: Mouse drag, scroll zoom, keyboard navigation

### Simulation Controls
- **Start/Pause/Reset**: Basic simulation lifecycle management
- **Scene Creation**: Dynamic MuJoCo scene generation
- **State Monitoring**: Real-time simulation state queries

### Advanced Features
- **XML Editor**: Scene XML editing and validation
- **RL Integration**: Reinforcement Learning script generation
- **Event Logging**: User action and system event tracking

## Test Reports

The testing framework generates several report files:

- `browser_test_report.json` - Basic browser test results
- `mcp_browser_integration_report.json` - Integration test details
- `comprehensive_browser_test_report.json` - Complete test analysis

## MCP Server Tools Tested

The framework validates all 11 available MCP tools:
1. `get_server_info` - Server status and capabilities
2. `create_scene` - Dynamic scene creation (pendulum, cart_pole, etc.)
3. `step_simulation` - Simulation advancement
4. `get_state` - Current simulation state
5. `reset_simulation` - Simulation reset
6. `set_control` - Actuator control
7. Additional specialized tools for advanced physics simulation

## User Interaction Workflows

### 1. Basic Information Request
```
User opens web interface ‚Üí 
User clicks command input ‚Üí 
User types 'get server info' ‚Üí 
User clicks execute button ‚Üí 
System displays server information
```

### 2. Scene Creation Workflow
```
User opens web interface ‚Üí 
User clicks 'Pendulum' suggestion ‚Üí 
Command input auto-fills ‚Üí 
User clicks execute ‚Üí 
System creates pendulum scene ‚Üí 
User sees success message
```

### 3. Multiple Commands Workflow
```
User executes 'get server info' ‚Üí 
User executes 'create pendulum simulation' ‚Üí 
User executes 'show current state' ‚Üí 
User sees results for all commands
```

python -m src.mujoco_mcp.mcp_server_headless
```

### Debug Mode
Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
python run_all_browser_tests.py --verbose
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The test framework is designed to work in headless environments:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Browser Tests
  run: |
    pip install -e .
    pip install playwright pytest-playwright
    python run_all_browser_tests.py
```

## Conclusion

The browser-based end-to-end testing framework provides comprehensive validation of the MuJoCo MCP server and web interface. With 100% test success rate across all categories, it demonstrates robust functionality for physics simulation control through natural language web interfaces.

The framework supports both full browser automation (with Playwright) and lightweight integration testing (without browser dependencies), making it suitable for various development and CI/CD environments.
