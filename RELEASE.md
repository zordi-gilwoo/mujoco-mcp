# 🚀 MuJoCo MCP v0.1.0 Release

## 🎉 First Stable Release

We're excited to announce the first stable release of MuJoCo MCP - a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI agents like Claude to control MuJoCo physics simulations through natural language commands.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **🤖 Natural Language Control**: Control robots and simulations using conversational commands
- **🔧 MCP Protocol Support**: Full implementation of Anthropic's Model Context Protocol
- **🎯 Advanced Robot Control**: Pick-and-place, trajectory planning, and complex manipulation tasks
- **🔒 Enhanced Security**: Multi-layer authorization, rate limiting, and parameter validation
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Setup guides, API reference, and example code
- **🧪 Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for reliability

### 📦 What's Included

#### Core Components
- `MuJoCoSimulation`: Core physics simulation wrapper
- `MuJoCoMCPServer`: FastMCP-based server implementation
- `EnhancedAuthManager`: Security and authorization layer
- Complete MCP resource and tool implementations

#### Example Demos
- **Basic Control**: Simple pendulum and joint control
- **Robot Arm Demo**: Advanced pick-and-place with multiple objects
- **Figure-8 Trajectory**: Smooth motion planning demonstrations
- **LLM Integration**: Multiple examples of AI-controlled simulations

#### Documentation
- **CLAUDE_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step guide for Claude Desktop/Cursor integration
- **README.md**: Comprehensive project overview and quick start
- **API Documentation**: Clear interface specifications

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mujoco-mcp.git
cd mujoco-mcp

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or use the install script
./tools/install.sh  # Unix/Linux/macOS
./tools/install.bat # Windows
```

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the Demo Server**:
   ```bash
   python examples/mcp_demo.py
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** (see CLAUDE_SETUP.md for details)

3. **Try Natural Language Commands**:
   - "Start the robot demo and pick up the red cube"
   - "Make the robot draw a figure-8 pattern"
   - "Move the arm to position 0.3, 0.2, 0.4"

### 🔄 Changes from Pre-release

This release represents a major refactoring from the initial implementation:

- ✅ Fixed critical architectural issues
- ✅ Unified dependency management (FastMCP)
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate implementations
- ✅ Resolved all import and circular dependency issues
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Improved documentation and examples

### 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MuJoCo physics engine (installed automatically)
- FastMCP framework
- NumPy, SciPy, Pydantic

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Visualization requires separate `mujoco-viewer` installation
- Some advanced OSC features are planned for future releases
- Windows support may require additional configuration
